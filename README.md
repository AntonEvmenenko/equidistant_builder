# Equidistant Builder

![](./screenshots/demo_animation.gif)

This project is dedicated to solving an interesting problem that I came across on the Internet. The problem can be described roughly as follows:

> Given a 2D path represented by a set of line segments and arcs, the objective is to calculate the equidistant path, which should also be represented as a set of line segments and arcs.

This PoC project was developed from scratch over a few evenings. C++ and Qt were used for implementation. The project has no external dependencies. From an algorithmic perspective, the problem was solved straightforwardly, leaving ample room for optimizations. The code most likely contains bugs.
